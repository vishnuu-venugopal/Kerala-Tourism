Surely long before Sage Parasurama , according to local legend, threw his divine battle axe from Kanyakumari to Gokarnam to west Kerala, God’s own land, from the Varuna the sea god; before the times of Mahabali the democratic and just ruler of this wonderful land who was sent down to the netherworld through deceit. It doesnt take any flights of fancy to imagine that this land fired the imaginations of intrepid travellers and explorers like Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Marco Polo, Fa Hien, and quite possibly, countless others from the pages of history, recorded or not</p>

            <p style="color: black;">The Padmanabhaswamy temple is a Hindu temple located in Thiruvananthapuram, the state capital of Kerala, India. 
              The name of the city of Thiruvananthapuram in Malayalam translates to "The City of Lord Ananta", (The City Of Lord Vishnu) referring to the deity of the Padmanabhaswamy temple. The temple is built in an intricate fusion of the Chera style and the Dravidian style of architecture, featuring high walls, and a 16th-century gopura.While the Ananthapura temple at Kumbla in Kasaragod is considered the original seat of the deity ("Moolasthanam"), architecturally to some extent, the temple is a replica of the Adikesava Perumal temple in Thiruvattar.
              The principal deity Padmanabhaswamy (Vishnu) is enshrined in the "Anantha Shayana" posture, the eternal yogic sleep on the infinite serpent Adi Shesha.[5] Padmanabhaswamy is the tutelary deity of the royal family of Travancore. The titular Maharaja of Travancore,
               Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma, is the trustee of the temple.</p>

            <p style="color: black;">Vellayani Lake, or Vellayani Kayal as known in local language, is the largest fresh water lake in Thiruvananthapuram district, of Kerala, India.
              It is around 9 km away from the Thiruvananthapuram Central Bus Station at Thampanoor. Buses ply to Vellayani Lake from City Depot at East Fort also. It is at a distance of 7 km from Kovalam via Poonkulam junction.
              A road passes through this lake; a bund has been constructed for this purpose. This lake attracts a lot of tourists. Once in Kovalam, a visitor should not allow to miss the opportunity of seeing this wonder lake of freshwater. Its crystal-clear calm water, especially during moonlit nights, is a craze for the minds. The locals say a side of the lake is Kochu Kovalam, meaning tiny Kovalam.[citation needed]
              There is a boat race in the lake during Onam which attracts a huge crowd. Country boat service is available from Kovalam beach to reach the lake.

            </u></b></h4>
            <p style="color: black;">The Attukal Bhagavathy Temple is a Hindu religious shrine at Attukal in Kerala, India. 
              Goddess Bhadrakali (Kannaki), mounted over 'vethala', is the main deity in this temple. Bhadrakali, 
              a form of Mahakali, who killed the demon king Daruka, believed to be born from the third eye of lord Shiva. 
              'Bhadra' means good and 'Kali' means goddess of time.
               So Bhadrakali is considered as the goddess of prosperity and salvation. 
               Goddess 'Attukal devi', itself is the supreme mother 'Bhaadrkali devi', (in soumya aspect) the goddess of power and courage. 
               She is often referred as Kannaki, the heroine of Ilanko Adikal's 'Silapathikaaram'. 
               The temple is renowned for the annual Attukal Pongal festival, in which over three million women participate.
               A festival that has figured in the Guinness Book of World Records for being the single largest gathering of women for a religious activity, the Attukal Pongala continues to draw millions of women with each passing year. 
               Attukal Temple is situated near the heart of the city, 2 kilometres away from Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple, East Fort in Thiruvananthapuram. 
               Attukal devi is often worshipped in 3 forms such as Maha Saraswati (goddess of knowledge, arts, and language), Maha Lakshmi (goddess of wealth, auspiciousness, and power) 
              and Mahakali/ Parvathy (goddess of marriage, time, death).</p>

            </u></b></h4>
            <p style="color: black;">Kuthiramalika ('Mansion of horses') is a palace built by Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma on the south-eastern side of Padmanabhaswamy temple, Thiruvananthapuram.
              The palace gets its name from the 122 horses that are carved into the wooden wall brackets that support the southern roof. The official name of the palace is Puthen Malika (New Mansion). The palace forms part of a vast complex of royal buildings in the vicinity of Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The building was left unoccupied for more than a century, following the demise of Swathi Thirunal in 1846.
              Built in the 1840s, Kuthiramalika is an example of traditional Kerala architecture, with its typical sloping roofs, overhanging eaves, pillared verandahs and enclosed courtyards. 
              Intricate carvings adorn the wooden ceilings, with each room having a distinctive pattern. 
              The construction of the palace was completed by 5000 Vishwabrahmins in four years. 
              The palace is made from teakwood, rosewood, marble, and granite.
              The roof of the palace is made of wood and 42 beams support the carved patterns.
              The roof is supported by granite pillars. Floral motifs dot the ceiling of the verandah.
              The main 16 rooms of the palace are constructed in 16 different patterns.
              In all, the palace contains 80 rooms, of which 20 were opened for visitors in 1995.
              The floor inside the palace is made of egg whites, charcoal, and limestone, which make it cold and smooth even in hot weather conditions.
              The concert venue built in the palace premises uses traditional sound reflectors comprising fifty clay pots hung upside down from the ceiling.
